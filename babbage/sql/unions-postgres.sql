  ('Dance Floor',
   '&lt;p&gt;All student groups, departments, and off-campus guests of the Unions are required to rent a dance floor from the Unions when dances are held in carpeted rooms or areas. Customers wanting to have a dance in a carpeted room must request the dance floor when making the reservations. Extra setup time of one hour is required for groups using a dance floor. When planning an event, please allow for the additional setup time and budget accordingly for the setup rates listed below:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;The use of the dance floor is restricted to rooms on the north wing of Memorial Student Union.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The dance floor incurs a fee of $250. This includes setup and tear down of the floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The Unions retain the right to deny the use of the dance floor or limit the size based upon the availability of staff, equipment or intended use.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;If the Unions does not have a dance floor available for an event, the sponsoring group is responsible for the renting and setup of a dance floor from an outside vendor. The &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:unions@missouri.edu&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;Unions Administration&lt;/a&gt; must pre-approve the use of any outside dance floor.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;',

  ('Grills',
   '&lt;p&gt;In order to reduce the risks of property damage, loss of life, and preserve the beauty of our facilities we require that you adhere to the following guidelines below when hosting events that utilize grills or other sources of open flames. Failure to adhere to these guidelines will result in revocation of the reservation or event cancellation.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Prior to the Event:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;An &lt;a href=&quot;http://ehs.missouri.edu/fire/open-flames.html&quot;&gt;Open Flame Permit&lt;/a&gt; request must be completed and submitted to &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:dorthd@missouri.edu&quot;&gt;David Dorth&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;mailto:pasleyjam@missouri.edu&quot;&gt;Jim Pasley&lt;/a&gt; at Environmental Health & Services (EHS) at least one week prior to the scheduled event. EHS may need to conduct a site visit prior to approval.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;a href=&quot;http://ehs.missouri.edu/food/permits.html&quot;&gt;Temporary Food Permit&lt;/a&gt; request must be completed and submitted for any event that will be serving food, even if catered.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please contact &lt;a href=&quot;http://ehs.missouri.edu/about/contact.html&quot;&gt;EHS&lt;/a&gt; for any inquiries relating to the permit acquisition process.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Setup Specifications:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain at least 10 ft. away from the building at all times. Excessive concentrations of smoke will discolor and damage the limestone façade. Additionally, do not place coals directly on concrete, brick, or grass. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Stay away from building entrances and exits. Ensure that emergency egress routes remain unobstructed.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;The North sidewalk that runs the length of the Student Center is a fire department access road that must remain clear of obstructions.  Event setups must remain a minimum distance of 20ft. from the perimeter of the building&#39;s North side.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Avoid areas near intake ductwork that can allow smoke to waft into the building, triggering fire alarms and disturbing building occupants. This also reduces the likelihood that the building occupants may smell smoke which could lead them to think there is a fire. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain a minimum of 15 ft. clearance around the grill(s) to limit the possibility of errant embers igniting or damaging nearby equipment.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Maintain an ABC multipurpose fire extinguisher nearby and have knowledge of how to use it.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;P.A.S.S.&lt;/strong&gt; = &lt;strong&gt;P&lt;/strong&gt;ull the pin, &lt;strong&gt;A&lt;/strong&gt;im at the base of the fire, &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;queeze the handle and &lt;strong&gt;S&lt;/strong&gt;weep from side to side.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Cleanup:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Assure all coals are “cold-out” prior to relocating the grill(s) or abandoning the area. The coals may appear extinguished, however, they may still be smoldering internally. Do not place coals in the trash where they may ignite a fire.  Dispose of cold coals properly at an off campus location.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Propane and other pressurized fuel tanks cannot be stored inside the building.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Rainy Forecast:&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;If rain is forecasted for an event hosted outside, preparations can be made through the Events Management & Guests Relations Office for an alternate rain site location. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;During rainy weather the grill may be situated outside the loading dock while adhering to the aforementioned clearance requirements. The cooking crew may take cover in the loading dock and then tend to the grill outside as needed. Under no circumstances may the grill be operated inside the loading dock. The grill must be located at least 10 ft. away from the threshold of the overhead doors.  The reason for this is two-fold. There are smoke detectors throughout the ductwork that may trigger a false alarm due to wafting smoke. Secondly, this reduces the risk of stray embers igniting the contents of the adjacent compactors. &lt;/p&gt;',

  ('Alcohol',
   '&lt;p&gt;The use or possession of any alcoholic beverage is prohibited on all University property, except in the residences of the President and Chancellors and in designated facilities, and for single events or reoccurring similar events where the sale, use or possession of alcohol may be allowed by appropriate University approval, subject to all legal requirements.&lt;br/&gt; The department or organization making a request to use alcoholic beverages on the MU campus must submit a University of Missouri Request to Use Alcoholic Beverages on University Property form to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://businessservices.missouri.edu/services/alcohol-use.html&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt; MU Business Services Office&lt;/a&gt; no less than two weeks in advance of the event.

There must be a designated Responsible Person at the actual event. The Responsible Person needs to sign the form indicating they accept personal responsibility for ensuring that University policy and state laws governing use of alcoholic beverages are complied with, and accept financial responsibility for the activity. &lt;br/&gt; The University does not have a license to sell alcohol except in certain venues. If alcohol is going to be sold, a licensed business must be engaged to do so at the event.&lt;/p&gt;',
